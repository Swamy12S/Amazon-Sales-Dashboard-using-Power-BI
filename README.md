## Project Objective :
project is to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights from Amazon sales data. The dashboard aims to:
Track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total profit, quantity sold, average delivery time, and category-wise performance.
Analyze sales trends across regions, products, and time periods to identify growth opportunities.
Simplify complex datasets into visual insights for quick decision-making by stakeholders.
Support business strategy and planning by highlighting top-performing products, customer trends, and operational bottlenecks.
## Dataset Used :
Source: Amazon Sales Data (Kaggle Example Dataset)
